    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      Le 716 is the friendly spot in Le Muy: a French-style bar-restaurant, modern, welcoming,
      and the place to enjoy a great meal with family or friends.

        Everything is <strong>homemade</strong>, with fresh products checked daily and handled with full compliance
        (labeling, storage, traceability — as required by law).  
        The cuisine is generous and effective: the <strong>“Le 716” Salad</strong> is our revisited version of the Caesar — ultra gourmet — and our desserts complete the experience.
